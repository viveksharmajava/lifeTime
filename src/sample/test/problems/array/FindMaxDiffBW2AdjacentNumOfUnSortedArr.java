 * input is unsorted array , you need to return max difference between 2 adjacent number
 * 
 * Approach : Use bucket (range element for example bucket 1 may contain elements which has value 1-10 etc).
 *            and then keep track of min and max of each bucket.
 *            
 *            to get the result check for max difference between lower bucket's max and upper bucket's min.
 *
