	/**
	 *Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
DEFINITION
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node’s next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
EXAMPLE
Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
Output: C

		 n1 = n1.next;
		n2 = n2.next.next;

		 break;
		 }

		 // Error check - there is no meeting point, and therefore no loop
		 if (n2.next == null) {

		 /* Move n1 to Head. Keep n2 at Meeting Point. Each are k steps
		 /* from the Loop Start. If they move at the same pace, they must
		 * meet at Loop Start. */
