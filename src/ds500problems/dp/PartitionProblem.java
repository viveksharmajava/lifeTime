/*
 * Problem statement: 
 *    Given a set of positive integers,
 *    find if it can be divided into two subsets with equal sum.
 *    Consider S = {3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1}
		 
		We can partition S into two partitions, each having a sum of 5.
		 
		S1 = {1, 1, 1, 2}
		S2 = {2, 3}
		 
		Note that this solution is not unique. Hereâ€™s another solution.
		 
		S1 = {3, 1, 1}
		S2 = {2, 2, 1}
 *    Solution: 
 *     calculate total sum of given array if sum is odd then
 *     it can not be divided into 2 parts.
 *     If sum is even then find the sub-set elements of given array which
 *     sum is total_sum/2.
 *     We can use modified knapsack solution here:
 *     1. calculate  the sum including  current element. and recur the solution
 *        for remaining element.
 *     2. calculate  the sum excluding  current element. and recur the solution
 *        for remaining element.
 *     Finally:return true if we get the sub-set which sum is total_sum/2 from including
 *             or excluding the elements. else return the false.
 *
